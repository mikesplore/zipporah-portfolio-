          Hello! I'm <span className="font-semibold text-blue-500">Zipporah Mutanu</span>, a passionate and driven technology enthusiast with a strong foundation in Information Technology and a deep desire to solve problems through innovation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I hold a background in <span className="font-medium">Information Technology</span>, which has equipped me with a broad set of technical skills and a deep understanding of how technology can transform lives and businesses.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My journey in tech began with curiosity—how do websites work? how is software built?—and evolved into a full-blown passion for web development, data, and digital problem-solving. I enjoy building web applications that are clean, modern, and intuitive, and I’m constantly learning new tools and technologies to stay current and competitive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My career aspirations are focused on growing as a full-stack developer, contributing to meaningful projects, and eventually leading teams that develop inclusive, scalable, and innovative digital solutions. I’m also deeply interested in empowering young women in tech and sharing knowledge through community involvement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Beyond the screen, I enjoy reading inspirational books, exploring nature, listening to music, and engaging in conversations that spark creativity and growth.
